<h2>Access modifiers</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>You've probably seen the following piece of code:  </p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) { 
    // some code goes here
}</code></pre>
<p>Ever wondered why the word "public" is used? It means that the <code class="language-java">main(...)</code> method is available to everyone. The word <code class="language-java">public</code> is an <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6692" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, access modifiers are special keywords that specify who is allowed to use your code or a part of it. | They can be placed in front of any field, method, or class. There are four different access modifiers in Java: private, package-private (also known as default), protected, and public. The private access modifier is only accessible within the class itself. The package-private access modifier is accessible to classes from the same package. The protected access modifier is accessible to classes from the same package and any extending class. The public access modifier can be accessed from anywhere.">access modifier</a></strong>, a special <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the programming language and is reserved for a specific use. | Keywords cannot be used as variable names in your own program. They have a predefined purpose in the Java language and are used by the Java compiler to parse and understand the code. Examples of keywords include public, class, and void. Understanding keywords is crucial for writing valid Java code and for debugging any syntax errors that may occur.">keyword</a> that specifies who is allowed to use your code or a part of it. It can be placed in front of any field, method, or class.</p>
<p>So, you already know at least one of the access modifiers! The others are: <code class="language-java">package-private</code>, <code class="language-java">protected</code>, and <code class="language-java">private</code>. Why do we need them? Let's find out.</p>
<h5 id="ok-so-why-should-i-use-them">OK, so why should I use them?</h5>
<p>There are two main reasons to take access under control: clarity and safety of code.</p>
<p><strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3513" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, code clarity refers to the readability and understandability of the code. | It is achieved by writing code that is easy to follow, consistent, and well-documented. This can be done by using meaningful variable and method names, adding comments to explain complex sections of code, and following a consistent coding style throughout the program. Code clarity is important because it makes the code easier to maintain, debug, and extend, which ultimately saves time and reduces errors. Additionally, clear code is more accessible to other developers, making collaboration and code review more efficient.">Code clarity</a>.</strong> Imagine your code is an engine of a washing machine with functions such as choosing a washing program or starting a washing process. How can we help the user figure out how to wash their clothes? We can cover the engine with the body and add buttons for choosing a washing mode and starting the process. The user doesn't need to know what is going on inside the machine’s body; the buttons to get the result are more than enough.</p>
<p>That’s how access control helps in code – you can <strong>“hide” the engine from the user </strong>by restricting access and simply providing them with the public “buttons”.</p>
<p><strong>Code safety. </strong>Now imagine you have developed a rather useful library that is used by other developers. One day Jane Doe wants to use your code’s functionality in her project, but the problem is that she needs to change one variable in one of your classes. If it is public, nothing can stop her from doing that in her code before using method A from the library.</p>
<p>What can happen if the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their value can be accessed and modified using the name. It's important to note that variables can be changed, meaning you can assign a new value to a variable without having to declare it again.">variable</a> is used somewhere in method B? The B method would probably start to act unpredictably. So, <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6692" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the protected access modifier indicates that a class member can be accessed from classes inside the same package and all subclasses of this class. | This level of access is less restrictive than the package-private modifier, which only allows access within the same package. The protected modifier is useful for sharing or granting specific permissions to subclasses or classes within the same package. Properly managing access to class members ensures that your code is used as intended and behaves as expected, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and functionality of your program.">protecting</a> important parts of your code is a guarantee that it will be<strong> used as an unmodifiable part </strong>and its behavior will be the exact one you have developed it for.</p>
<h5 id="public-and-package-private-classes">Public and package-private classes</h5>
<p>When you manage the access in your code, you divide objects of your program into two groups: top-level and low-level items. Fields and methods that are explicitly used outside the class are called top-level fields and methods. If fields and methods are used inside the class, they are known as low-level ones. This low-level and top-level logic is also applicable to classes.<br/><br/>Usually, using low-level items helps to unload top-level classes, methods, or fields to structure and decompose the code. If these items are not explicitly used, it will be efficient to restrict access to them.</p>
<p>Now let’s see how we can set <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10087" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a restriction refers to the limitations placed on the use and functionality of a record class. | Records in Java are implicitly final, cannot be abstract, and cannot extend any other class. They also cannot declare instance fields, except for those specified in the record signature, which are immutable. This means that once a record is created, its values cannot be changed. However, records can implement interfaces, be declared inside another class, be generic, have static components, and have constructors and instance methods. They are also compatible with annotations. Records cannot be abstract, extend a class, or be extended by any other class.">restrictions</a> to different parts of the code: a top-level class can have one of two following modifiers:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3621" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a package is a mechanism for organizing and structuring related classes and interfaces in a Java application. | They provide a way to group related classes together, making it easier to locate a specific class and avoiding naming conflicts by including the package path in the full class name. Package names are typically in lowercase and can contain other packages. They also allow controlling access to classes and members using access modifiers.">package</a>-private (default, no explicit modifier): </strong>visible only for classes from the same package;</p></li><li><p><strong>public:</strong> visible to all classes everywhere.</p></li></ul>
<p>Here is a class inside the package <code class="language-java">org.hyperskill.java.packages.theory.p1</code>. with default package-private access:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package org.hyperskill.java.packages.theory.p1;

class PackagePrivateClass{

}</code></pre>
<p>This class can be used only by other classes from the same package. It's not even visible for classes from any other package:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">org.hyperskill

org.hyperskill.java.packages.theory

default package</code></pre>
<p>Note the first two examples – if the class is package-private in package <code class="language-java">a.b</code>, it is still unavailable from package <code class="language-java">a.c</code> and package <code class="language-java">a</code> itself.</p>
<p>Here is a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a public class is the fundamental unit of a Java program and serves as the entry point for execution. | Every Java program must have at least one public class, which must be named appropriately and cannot start with a digit. The public class can contain fields, methods, and constructors, which define the properties and behavior of objects created from the class. It's important to note that a public class can be accessed from other packages, making it visible and usable outside of its defining package. This is in contrast to a package-private class, which is only visible to other classes within the same package.">public class</a> inside the package <code class="language-java">org.hyperskill.java.packages.theory.p2</code></p>

<p>The common way of using top-level class modifiers is:</p>
<ol><li><p>make the classes containing methods for users (the “buttons”) <strong>public</strong>;</p></li><li><p>make all other classes with low-level logic methods used by public ones <strong>package-private</strong> (cover the engine with the body).</p></li></ol>
<p>Remember: everything that’s not meant to be used/changed by classes from other packages should not be public.</p>
<h5 id="private-members">Private members</h5>
<p>A class member (a field or a method, e.g. <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3535" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a class constructor is a special method that initializes a new object of the class. | It has the same name as the class that contains it, and it has no return type. Constructors set values to the fields when the object is created, and they can take parameters for initializing fields with specific values. A class can have multiple constructors, which is known as constructor overloading. A constructor can also invoke another constructor of the same class, allowing you to initialize different parts of an object with different constructors. The Java compiler invokes the constructor's block as the first statement in the constructor, before other statements.">class constructor</a>) has more options to choose from: <strong>private</strong>, <strong>package-private</strong>, <strong>protected</strong>, and <strong>public</strong>. Let's consider member modifiers in more detail.</p>
<p>Fields are often declared <strong>private </strong>to control access to them from any other class. In some cases, these fields are only used internally in the class and there is no way to change or even access them from any other class. In other cases, it can be done via <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3599" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an accessor method, also known as a getter, is a method that allows the value of a field to be read without compromising encapsulation. | By using accessor methods, programmers can control how data is accessed, modify the implementation without affecting other parts of the code, and ensure security by hiding implementation details. Accessor methods only expose the state of an object to other classes while maintaining encapsulation. They are typically used in conjunction with mutator methods, also known as setters, which allow the value of a field to be changed.">accessor methods</a> </strong>(e.g. <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3599" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, getters and setters are methods used to protect and hide data when creating a class. | A getter method returns the value of a field, while a setter method sets or updates the value. Private fields are hidden from the rest of the code and make public methods more brief and readable. Getters and setters promote data encapsulation, which increases security and control over the data, and promotes a more organized code structure. They can also increase code readability and maintainability by hiding the implementation details of a class from the outside world. Additionally, getters and setters can contain more sophisticated logic, such as returning non-stored values or modifying the value of another field according to a change.">getters and setters</a>). <strong>Getter</strong> and <strong>setter</strong> methods are used to protect and hide your data when creating classes. A getter method returns the value of a field, while a setter method sets or updates the value. We will discuss the main features of getter and setter methods in further topics.</p>
<p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3599" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a private method is a method that is only accessible within the class where it is defined. | It has the private access modifier, which restricts its visibility and usage to the enclosing class. This means that a private method cannot be accessed from any other class, not even from classes in the same package. Private methods are typically used for encapsulating implementation details or helper methods that are not intended to be used directly by external code.">Private methods</a> are used to hide the internal low-level logic implementation from the rest of the code and make public methods more brief and readable.</p>
<p>Here is the class <code class="language-java">Counter</code> with the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3599" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a private field is a field that is declared with the access modifier 'private', which restricts access to that field to the class in which it is declared. | This means that other classes, even if they are in the same package, cannot directly access or modify the private field of the class. By using the private access modifier, you can encapsulate the implementation details of a class and provide a controlled interface for other classes to interact with it. Private fields are typically not exposed directly to other classes. Instead, they are made accessible through accessor methods, also known as getter and setter methods. These methods provide encapsulation, which allows you to hide implementation details and control data access, ensuring security. According to the data encapsulation principle, the field of a class should not be directly accessed from other classes. Instead, the field can be accessed only through the methods of that particular class. To access a hidden field, programmers write special types of methods called getters and setters. Getters can only read the field, and setters can only write to the field. For example, a class may have four fields, each of which is declared as private to hide the field from direct access from other classes. The class may also have public getters and setters for accessing the fields through these methods.">private field</a> <code class="language-java">current</code>. This field can be read with the method <code class="language-java">getCurrent()</code> , a getter method, and changed with the <code class="language-java">inc()</code> method. The last one is not exactly a setter method because it doesn't manually set a value to a <code class="language-java">current</code> variable, but just <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5008" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an increment is a fundamental operation used to increase the value of a variable by one. | It is represented by the increment operator (++). Java has two forms of the increment operator: prefix and postfix. In the prefix form, the value is incremented before it is used in a statement. In contrast, in the postfix form, the value is incremented after it is used. Understanding these forms is crucial because they can affect the result of a statement, especially when used in conjunction with other operators. For example, in the statement int a = 4; int b = ++a;, the value of 'a' is incremented to 5 before it is assigned to 'b', so 'b' becomes 5.">increments</a> it.</p>

   }


   private void inc(long val) {
       this.current += val;
   }

<p>Sometimes, a private class constructor is required. This type of constructor can only be used inside the class, e.g. from another constructor, which can be public or private, or from the class methods.</p>
<h5 id="package-private-members">Package-private members</h5>
<p>A<strong> package-private</strong> access modifier does not require any keyword. If a field, a method, or a constructor has this modifier, then it can be read or changed from any class inside the same package.</p>
<p>Let's see an example: here are two classes in the same package: <code class="language-java">Salary</code> and <code class="language-java">Promotion</code>.</p>
<p>The class <code class="language-java">Salary</code> has a package-private field and a constructor. An <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3549" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance refers to an object that is created from a class blueprint. | It represents a specific entity with its own set of attributes and behaviors. For example, in the context of comparing two instances of the class, it means comparing two objects created from the same class but possibly with different values. Instances have access to instance methods, which are methods that belong to each object created from the class. This means that each instance can have its own unique state, and the instance method can access and manipulate this state. To create an instance of a class, you can either call the constructor directly or use the `new` keyword. Additionally, you can obtain an instance of a class by having a reference to a class, such as through an object or a class literal.">instance of</a> the <code class="language-java">Salary</code> class can be created inside a <code class="language-java">Promotion</code> class, and the field can also be accessed by <code class="language-java">Promotion</code> and its members because they belong to the same package.</p>

    long income;

    Salary(long income) {
        this.income = income;
    }
}

    Salary salary;

    Promotion(Salary salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public void promote() {
        salary.income += 1500;
    }
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="protected-and-public-members">Protected and public members</h5>
<p>Disclaimer: you will learn to use these two modifiers later!</p>
<p>A <strong>protected </strong>access modifier means that a class member can be accessed from classes inside the same package and all subclasses of this class. For now, it is important to remember that the protected option is less restricting than package-private.</p>
<p>A<strong> public</strong> access modifier means that there is no restriction on using a field, method, or class. It's often used for constructors, and methods representing the class <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/36674" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of predefined methods, classes, and protocols that enable developers to interact with a specific software component or library. | It serves as a contract between the software provider and the user, specifying how the software can be used and what functionalities it exposes.

<p>Let's review the names of access modifiers (from most to least limiting):</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>private</strong> — available only inside a class;</p></li><li><p><strong>package-private</strong> (also known as <strong>default</strong>, implicit) — available for all classes in the same package;</p></li><li><p><strong>protected</strong> — available for classes in the same package and for <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3585" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a subclass is a class that is derived from another class, also known as a superclass or base class. | Subclasses inherit all public and protected fields and methods from their superclass and can also add new fields and methods.
