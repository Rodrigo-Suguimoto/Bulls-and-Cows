<h2>Instance methods</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>As you know, a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/19918" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a class is one of the fundamental concepts used to develop the logic of a program. | It is a template that defines properties and behaviors of objects. Fields in a class describe the properties of an object, while methods describe what an object can do. Classes can be divided into two groups: instance and static. Instance methods are unique to each instance of a class and can access and modify the state of that instance. Custom classes can be created to define fields and methods that are tailored to specific purposes.">class</a> is one of the fundamental concepts in Java. You develop the logic of a program by creating <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11523" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a field is a variable that stores data within a class. | It can hold any type of data, including primitive types (such as int, float, boolean) and class types. A class can have multiple fields, and they can have different access modifiers. When a field is declared as static, it belongs to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class, and shares the same value for all instances. It is a common practice to declare a static field as a global variable to save memory.">fields</a> and methods inside classes. Fields describe an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an object is an instance of a particular class that defines its properties and possible behaviors. | Each object has its own state, separated from other objects, and is accessed using a reference, which stores the memory address where the actual object is located. Objects from the standard library, such as String and Date, as well as programmer-defined classes, are all reference types. The new keyword is used to create an object of a particular class. For example, String str = new String(hello); creates a new String object with the value hello. Objects have a unique identity, can be managed, and have a human-readable representation.">object</a>'s properties and methods describe what an object does. In this topic, we will go on to discuss the nature of methods in Java. All methods can be divided into two groups: <strong>instance</strong><em> </em>and<em> </em><strong>static</strong>. We were mostly focused on the static ones previously, so now let's learn more about <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3534" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance method is a method that belongs to each object created of a particular class. | It can access fields of the specific object of the class. For example, if we have a class with two instance methods: method1() and method2(), and two objects: object1 and object2, the output of these methods will be different for each object because they have different values for the fields. To use an instance method, you must first create an object.">instance methods</a> to better understand the differences between the two. </p>
<h5 id="whats-the-difference">What's the difference?</h5>
<p>Let's look at the code below. Here we have a class named <code class="language-java">Human</code> with two fields and two methods. </p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Human {
    String name;
    int age;

    public static void printStatic() {
        System.out.println("It's a static method");
    }

    public void printInstance() {
        System.out.println("It's an instance method");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a modifier is a keyword that is used to change the meaning or behavior of a program element, such as a class, method, or variable. | There are two types of modifiers in Java: access modifiers and non-access modifiers. Access modifiers define the visibility of a method or class and determine where it can be accessed from. Non-access modifiers provide information about the behavior of a method or class to the JVM. For example, the static modifier indicates that a method belongs to a class and can be accessed without creating an object. The modifier final indicates that a variable cannot be changed once it has been assigned a value.">modifier</a> <code class="language-java">public</code>  isn't important for us now. It just means that other classes can also get <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3589" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, access modifiers are keywords used to determine who can access the code, specifically fields, methods, and classes. | There are four access modifiers in Java: private, protected, default (no keywords), and public. These modifiers are used to ensure the clarity and safety of the code by controlling who can access the code. The private modifier restricts access to the class itself, while the protected modifier allows access to classes in the same package and any extending class. The default modifier, also known as package-private, allows access to classes in the same package. The public modifier allows access from anywhere.">access</a> to our methods.</p>
<p>As you see, the methods <code class="language-java">printStatic</code> and <code class="language-java">printInstance</code> have differences in <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3489" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a declaration is a statement that introduces a variable, method, or class into the program. | It specifies the type of the entity being declared, its name, and other relevant information such as access modifiers, return type (for methods), and initial values (for variables). For example, the declaration of a method may include its name, return type, access modifier, and parameter list. Declarations are essential for Java to understand the structure and behavior of the program. Incorrect declarations can lead to compilation errors. Java 10 introduced type inference, which allows developers to use the var keyword instead of a specific type, and the type is automatically inferred based on the assigned value.">declaration</a>. When you see a method, you can easily understand: if there is a word <code class="language-java">static</code>, then the method is <strong>static</strong>; if there is no word <code class="language-java">static</code>, then the method is an <strong>instance </strong>one.</p>
<p>Now let's see what this really means!</p>
<h5 id="understanding-static-and-instance">Understanding: static and instance </h5>
<p>To <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7762" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, invoke refers to the process of calling or executing a method. | When a method is invoked, a new stack frame is created in the call stack to store information about the method execution, such as method parameters, local variables, and intermediate computations. The call stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the most recently added stack frame will be executed first. The stack frame is removed from the call stack once the method execution is complete. The invocation of methods allows for the creation of complex and modular code in Java.">invoke</a> a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3534" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a static method is a method that is associated with a class rather than an instance of a class. | It can be accessed directly using the class name and does not require the creation of a class instance. A static method can only access static fields and other static methods within the same class, and cannot refer to the `this` keyword because there is no instance context. Static methods are often used as utility methods that provide common functionality for the entire project. They can be called from instance methods, but not the other way around.">static method</a> we don't need to create an object. We just call the method with the class name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) {

    Human.printStatic(); // will print "It's a static method"
}
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, you can say that a static method belongs to a class (because we don't need an object).</p>
<p>An instance method requires a different <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7762" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an invocation refers to the process of calling or executing a method. | When a method is invoked, a new stack frame is created in the call stack to store the method's parameters, return address, and local variables. The stack stores references to objects in heap memory, while storing the actual values of primitive types. Method invocation can involve built-in or user-defined methods, as well as instance methods or class methods. The invocation process allows for the execution of code in a modular and organized manner, enabling code reuse and abstraction.">invocation</a>. As you already guessed, to invoke an instance method we have to create an object first. Otherwise, there is no way to use an instance method.</p>
<p>It's called an instance method because an instance is a concrete representation of an object.</p>
<p>Here we <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10973" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a call refers to the act of instructing the program to execute a specific set of code within a method. | It involves using the method's name and providing the necessary arguments. The method called (or invoked) depends on the passed parameters. If different values are passed to it, the result of the program will also change. However, when calling a function, you should always provide the correct number and type of arguments that the function expects. For instance, if there is another method that takes a student's name, age, and average score as parameters and prints them, the call to this method will depend on the provided parameters. If the application does not throw an exception, a stack trace message will not be displayed. However, a stack trace can be obtained at any specific point by calling the appropriate method, which will return an array.">call</a> the method <code class="language-java">printInstance</code> for two different objects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    Human peter =  new Human();
    peter.printInstance(); // will print "It's an instance method"

    Human alice =  new Human();
    alice.printInstance(); // will print "It's an instance method"
}</code></pre>
<p>So, we can say that an instance method is a method that belongs to each object that we created of the particular class. </p>
<h5 id="instance-methods-features">Instance methods: features</h5>
<p>Instance methods have a great advantage: they can access fields of the particular object of the class.</p>
<p>To illustrate the feature, let's modify our class <code class="language-java">Human</code>. We have one static method <code class="language-java">averageWorking</code> and two instance methods: <code class="language-java">work</code> and <code class="language-java">workTogetherWith</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Human {
    String name;
    int age;

    public static void averageWorking() {
        System.out.println("An average human works 40 hours per week.");
    }

    public void work() {
        System.out.println(this.name + " loves working!");
    }

    public void workTogetherWith(Human other) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " loves working with " + other.name + '!');
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the programming language and is reserved for a specific use. | Keywords cannot be used as variable names in your own program. They have a predefined purpose in the Java language and are used by the Java compiler to parse and understand the code. Examples of keywords include public, class, and void. Understanding keywords is crucial for writing valid Java code and for debugging any syntax errors that may occur.">keyword</a> <code class="language-java">this</code> represents a particular <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3549" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance refers to an object that is created from a class blueprint. | It represents a specific entity with its own set of attributes and behaviors. For example, in the context of comparing two instances of the class, it means comparing two objects created from the same class but possibly with different values. Instances have access to instance methods, which are methods that belong to each object created from the class. This means that each instance can have its own unique state, and the instance method can access and manipulate this state. To create an instance of a class, you can either call the constructor directly or use the `new` keyword. Additionally, you can obtain an instance of a class by having a reference to a class, such as through an object or a class literal.">instance of</a> the class.</p>
<p>It's easier to understand by an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    Human.averageWorking(); // "An average human works 40 hours per week."

    Human peter =  new Human();
    peter.name = "Peter";
    peter.work(); // "Peter loves working!"

        
    Human alice =  new Human();
    alice.name = "Alice";
    alice.work(); // "Alice loves working!"

    peter.workTogetherWith(alice); // "Peter loves working with Alice!"
}</code></pre>
<p>Look, now we have different outputs for the method <code class="language-java">work</code> because two different objects have different values for <code class="language-java">name</code>. First, we created <code class="language-java">peter</code> and gave him a name, then by invoking <code class="language-java">peter.work()</code> we actually saw his name in the output. We did the same with <code class="language-java">alice</code> and also saw her name in the output.</p>
<p>Look at the <code class="language-java">workTogetherWith</code> method. The keyword <code class="language-java">this</code> allows us to access a field of the particular object and distinguish it from the same field of another object.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>In this case, keyword <code class="language-java">this</code> is optional, so the code will work the same without it. But it's a good practice to add it to avoid confusion.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, instance methods can take <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/12877" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an argument, in the context of testing, refers to the input value or values provided to a test method. | These arguments can be a single value or a sequence of values, which can be of various types such as primitives, strings, arrays, collections, etc. Argument sources are used to supply these values, which can be a sequence of literal values, command-line arguments, or an array or stream of arguments generated by a method. When a test method has multiple parameters, the argument source method must return a collection, stream, or array of arrays of the appropriate type.">arguments</a> and <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a return value is the result that a method gives after executing its logic. | A method can return a value of a specific data type, or it can return no value, using the void keyword. If a method has a return type, it must include a return statement to provide the result. When invoking a method that returns a value, you can store it in a variable, print it, or pass it as an argument to another method.">return values</a> just as you saw in the previous topics. Return values can be of any type including the same <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3492" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a type is a classification used to represent different kinds of data, such as integers, characters, or objects. | It can be a primitive type, like int or boolean, or a reference type, like arrays, classes, or interfaces.

This allows for more abstract and reusable code, as the same class or method can process different types of data in the same way.">type</a> as the defined class.</p>
<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>In Java, every method should be declared within a class. The difference between instance and the static methods lies in whether they interact with an object or not. Let's recap:</p>
<ul><li><p>static method is associated with the class as a whole;</p></li><li><p>an instance method can only be invoked through an instance of a class, so that you have to create an object first;</p></li><li><p>instance methods can access the fields of the class with <code class="language-java">this</code> keyword.</p></li></ul>
<p>Instance methods allow programmers to manipulate particular objects of a class. And because of it, they give us more functionality and are used more often than static methods!</p>
