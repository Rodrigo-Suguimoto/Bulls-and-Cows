<h2>Processing strings</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>As you already know, a string is a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3514" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a sequence of characters refers to a series of individual symbols that are arranged in a specific order. | This can include alphabets, digits, whitespaces, and other symbols. A single character is represented using a character literal, which is denoted by a single quote. For example, 'a' represents a character literal. On the other hand, a string is a sequence of characters that are encapsulated by double quotes. It represents text-based information, such as an advertising line or a webpage. Strings in Java are similar to arrays and can be processed in a similar manner. Java uses Unicode as its native character encoding format, which means that every character in Java is represented by a unique numerical value, called a code point. It is possible to convert a string into an array of characters using special methods like the toCharArray() method.">sequence of characters</a> with a single data type, and so is an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3511" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an array is a collection of elements of the same type, allowing sequential storage and processing of elements as a single unit. | To use an array, you declare, instantiate, and initialize it, and can then access its elements to change their values. The number of elements an array can store is established when it's created and cannot be changed. However, stored elements can be modified at any time.">array</a>. Strings are similar to arrays in many ways: in some sense, a string looks like an array of characters. Moreover, you can iterate over both strings and arrays. Sometimes you may need to process a string and convert it into an array, and in this topic we'll learn how to do that.</p>
<h5 id="strings-and-arrays" style="text-align: center;">Strings and arrays</h5>
<p>It's possible to convert between strings and character arrays using special methods like <code class="language-java">valueOf()</code> and <code class="language-java">toCharArray()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">char[] chars = { 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' };

String stringFromChars = String.valueOf(chars); // "ABCDEF"

char[] charsFromString = stringFromChars.toCharArray(); 
// { 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' }

String theSameString = new String(charsFromString); // "ABCDEF"</code></pre>
<p>There is another way to turn a string into an array. Take a look:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String text = "Hello";
String[] parts = text.split(""); // {"H", "e", "l", "l", "o"}</code></pre>
<p>Here we used a much more concise method that <em>splits</em> a string into parts. Let's explore it in more detail!</p>
<h5 id="splitting-the-string" style="text-align: center;">Splitting the string</h5>
<p>A string can be divided into an array of strings based on a delimiter. To perform this, we call the <code class="language-java">split</code> method, which divides the string into substrings by a <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9055" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a separator is a single unit of meaning in a program that is used by the Java compiler to parse and understand the code. | It is a fundamental element of Java's syntax and can be a keyword, identifier, literal, operator, or separator. Separators are separated by whitespace and must adhere to the specific rules of Java syntax. Understanding separators is crucial for writing valid Java code and for debugging any syntax errors that may occur.">separator</a></strong>. In the previous example, we used the <code class="language-java">""</code> delimiter, which automatically splits a string into smaller elements (substrings) that consist of one char.</p>
<p>If the delimiter is specified, the method returns an array of all the substrings. Note that the delimiter itself is not included in any of the substrings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String sentence = "a long text";
String[] words = sentence.split(" "); // {"a", "long", "text"}</code></pre>
<p>Let's try to split an American phone number into the country code, the area code, the central office code, and other remaining <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3517" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a digit is a single numerical figure that contributes to the overall value of a number. | It can be an integer or a fractional part of a number, separated by a dot. When declaring a variable with a decimal value, you can use the 'float' or 'double' data types. For example, 3.14 is a float literal, while 3.14159 is a double literal. The special letter 'f' or 'F' is used to denote a float, while the absence of it implies a double. It's recommended to use 'double' for better precision, except when dealing with numbers larger than two billion or when specificity is crucial.">digits</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String number = "+1-213-345-6789";
String[] parts = number.split("-"); // {"+1", "213", "345", "6789"}</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that all these parts are still strings no matter what they look like!</p>
<p>Choose your delimiter wisely, otherwise you might get some sentences that start with a space:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String text = "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.";
String[] parts = text.split(","); 
// {"That's one small step for a man", " one giant leap for mankind."}</code></pre>
<p>You can choose any delimiter you prefer, including a combination of spaces and words:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String text = "I'm gonna be a programmer";
String[] parts = text.split(" gonna be "); // {"I'm", "a programmer"}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see here, the <code class="language-java">split</code> method is also a good tool to get rid of something you don't need or don't want to use.</p>
<h5 id="iterating-over-a-string" style="text-align: center;">Iterating over a string</h5>
<p>It's possible to iterate over the characters of a string using a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3505" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a loop is a programming construct that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code either a fixed number of times or until a certain condition is met. | There are several types of loops in Java, including the for-loop, while-loop, and do-while loop. The for-loop is often used when the number of iterations is known, while the while and do-while loops are used when the number of iterations is unknown or variable. The for-each loop is a specific type of for-loop that is commonly used to iterate through each element of an array, string, or collection without using an index. Loops can be useful for performing various algorithms, iterating through arrays, and reading input from the standard input.">loop</a> <strong>(while</strong>, <strong>do-while</strong>, <strong>for-loop).</strong></p>
<p>See the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String scientistName = "Isaac Newton";

for (int i = 0; i &lt; scientistName.length(); i++) {
    System.out.print(scientistName.charAt(i) + " ");
}</code></pre>
<p>In strings, like in arrays, indexing begins from <code class="language-java">0</code>. In our example, the for-loop iterates over the string <code class="language-java">"Isaac Newton"</code> . With each <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3602" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, iteration refers to the process of repeatedly executing a block of code while a certain condition is true. | This is typically achieved using loops, which allow you to perform various algorithms, traverse an array or a collection, and read input from the standard input. The for-each loop, a specific kind of for loop, is commonly used to iterate through each element of an array, string, or collection without using their index. Although it has some limitations, it aids in code readability and prevents errors. Additionally, Java provides iterator and iterable interfaces for iterating over collections and lists.">iteration</a>, the <code class="language-java">charAt</code> method returns the current character at the <code class="language-java">i</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3511" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an index is a numerical value that refers to a specific element in an array, starting from 0 for the first element and going up to one less than the array's length for the last element. | For example, in an array of three elements, the first element has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and the third element has an index of 2. Accessing a non-existing element by an index will result in a runtime exception. It is important to be careful when indexing elements of an array, as incorrect indexing can lead to errors.">index</a>, and that character is then printed to the console, followed by a blank space.</p>
<p>Here is what the code outputs as a result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">I s a a c   N e w t o n </code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, you learned about different ways of processing a string. You can convert between a string and an array using the <code class="language-java">valueOf()</code> and <code class="language-java">toCharArray()</code> methods or divide a string into substrings with the help of the <code class="language-java">split()</code> method. You can also iterate over the characters of a string using a loop. All these methods will help you solve different tasks and improve your programming experience. </p>
